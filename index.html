                    <div class="col-sm-12">
                        <p class="textStory">Looking back, the first part of the name is simple to explain. 
                            People knew that AC stood for Aeternus Callous, but everyone always called it AC. 
                            With this in mind, Burnturrek simply made the abbreviation the official clan name. 
                            When people asked what the AC stood for, the answer was 'it has no meaning'.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <p class="textStory">
                            The reason why he added 'ReUnited' has to do with his ambitions and goals for the clan.
                            Back then the clan was falling apart with more and more members either becoming inactive or quitting. 
                            But Burnturrek was still determined to bring glory to the clan. 
                            He wanted to 'reunite' the clan he loved, maybe with different members, 
                            but in the end his ambition was to create a united AC that is stronger than the rest. Better than the rest. 
                            AC deserved glory and for that cause the clan had to be reunited as one again.
                        </p>

                        <p class="textStory">
                            With Burnturrek as it's leader, a lot of changes were made to the clan. 
                            A lot of members joined and left but the clan was healing again. A solid core was created. 
                            A core of people loyal to the cause and to the clan. 
                            These people are still in this clan even today, Amaya, LightningKakashi, Valex, Ajalaw, Urizen, N!kk!, Mihawk & Adojin. 
                            But also people who joined a little later like 00fly00, T-Red, Joe5, HiNxPeR and the family duo Ikezod and Lonsave. 
                            These people have stayed loyal to AC-R and lived it's history with it.

                            There are many great names to be mentioned when it comes down to honouring the loyalty that was shown. 
                            Names of people that are perhaps not found on the clan list anymore, 
                            but names that belong to people that will never be forgotten.

                            After N-A was revived, old AC-R members either had completely quit the game or 
                            had no idea it was back as only a few were still around. 
                            Notably, Clydee and Envy were some of the OG members that had come back to game. 
                            Envy had been playing the game more casually while Clydee had joined a clan with some other group of friends. 
                            As that clan was dying, Clydee fell in contact with Deity who at the time 
                            had shown some interest in coming back to the N-A scene, and it was decided. 
                            The epitome of what a strong clan built on good foundations was had to come back. 
                            The pinnacle of loyalty and quality - AC-R was coming back.

                            While Clydee was taking care of the early recruitment for the revival, he had to get envy on board. 
                            Although they simultaneously worked on recruiting they both knew their specialties 
                            so it was a smooth sail from this point on. 
                            Clydee took a leadership role taking care of managing the clan by enforcing certain regulations 
                            and making sure new members understood the philosophies behind the clan, 
                            while Envy worked with the warriors and the wars.

                            During this time Shred and Chuan, both prominent figures of the old era ACR had come back too, 
                            massively aiding in the process. Some of the people that got on board were proven veterans but most were new recruits. 
                            These new recruits showed great potential and the leadership of these proven veterans led to the clan 
                            getting 2 rings and one semifinals exit in its first 3 events - a sign things were done right. 
                            The clan not only nurtured great warriors but the essence of ACR signified true pride and strength 
                            as it did in the past, and will always remain as such.
